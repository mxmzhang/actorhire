My project is a site where people looking for others to pretend to be someone (i.e. for a prank, to be a fake date, for some random thing you lied about to get out of plans). Freelance actors can post their profiles, experience, and specialties, and users can hire them on a specific date and time with a request. When a specific time is chosen, that time no longer appears for other users for that specific actor.

I implemented a user interface primarily designed using Bootstrap and used express.js to manage the backend. User, actor, and hiring data was stored using PostgreSQL. There is a user registration and login feature, secured using bycrypt. I deployed the site using render. With more time, I hoped to allow actors to create accounts as well to post their profiles and be able to receive and approve requests.

I spent 7-8 hours on this project.

The site can be accessed using the link https://helpmepretend.onrender.com/. Since I'm on the free plan for render, the first loading of the site may take awhile, since requests for the server are slowed down after a period of inactivity, but the site should run normally from there.
